# Project 1: Delivery Done Right

## Task

The user will be able to search and filter restaurants by certain features. Features will include the restaurants near the user, delivery/no delivery/no contact delivery, nutrition & safety information. Future feature: extend the program to include grocery delivery information. The application will be using the following APIs:

- https://api.fda.gov/food
- https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api
- https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/

## User Story

```
AS A local eater
I WANT to find nearby restaurants that have delivery services along with nutrition information
```

WHEN I enter the input parameters and click the search button
THEN I am presented with information of restaurants with my search criteria
