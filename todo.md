AS A local eater
I WANT to find nearby restaurants that have delivery services along with nutrition information
SO THAT I can choose based on my preferences
WHEN I open the web application
THEN i am provided a list of Food Genre (types) as well as a search input form
WHEN the user starts his/her input search
THEN the user can enter text corresponding to the food that they want by zip code or mile radius
WHEN I enter the input parameters and click the search button

=> Joel takes control of the workflow from here
